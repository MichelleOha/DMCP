                David is an experienced adolescent and adult clinical psychologist in private practice on the lower North Shore of Sydney.
                
                <h3 class="page-title">Approach:</h3>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                David’s preference is to work collaboratively with clients, their GP and other specialist care providers in line with a shared care model of health care delivery.
                David is adept at providing a tailored approach to individual clients’ needs, drawing on a range of evidence-based treatments including CBT, ACT, DBT, CPT, EMDR and others.
                Individuals presenting to the clinic commonly seek assistance with the following problems (although this is far from an exhaustive list): anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, stress, trauma (PTSD), work and or domestic stressors, relational issues, alcohol/drug misuse.

                    <h4> David Merrick, Clinical Psychologist</h4>
                                            <p>David has 10 years of experience working in multidisciplinary health care teams and in private practice settings. His approach is adapted to individual clients’ needs and utilises evidence-based treatment modalities. David has been a practising psychologist since 2013. As a clinical psychologist, David commenced work with NSW Health in a community-based mental health service, working with adults, young people and families. Building upon his interest in developmental and educational psychology David gained invaluable experience as the clinical psychologist at a Sydney day and boarding school for boys. David also has significant experience working with Australian Defence Force personnel in on-base clinical psychology roles and in his private practice. David commenced part-time private practice, working predominantly with individuals, in 2016. Today, David works full-time with a wide range of presentations and is passionate about providing counselling and therapy on such issues as the personal impact of trauma and stress, as well as grief, loss, anxiety and depression.

                <h3 class="page-title">Rebates:</h3>
                <div class="paragraph">If you have been referred by your GP or other specialist provider under a Mental Health Care Plan you are entitled to a Medicare rebate of $131.65 (as of July 2022) for 20 sessions per calendar year.
                Most private health funds offer rebates for psychology consultations, however inclusion and rebate amounts vary depending on the level of cover you have. You will need to confirm with your health insurance provider.
                Late cancellation of or failure to attend your consultation attracts a fee equivalent to the full consultation fee and this is not claimable with either Medicare or private health funds.
